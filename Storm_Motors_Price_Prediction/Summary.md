# **Case Study: Storm Motors Price Prediction**

## **Problem Statement**  
Storm Motors is an e-commerce platform that facilitates the buying and selling of pre-owned cars. The company has collected data for the year 2015-2016, which includes:  
- Car specifications  
- Condition of the car  
- Seller details  
- Registration details  
- Web advertisement details  
- Make and model information  
- Price  

## **Objective**  
Storm Motors aims to develop an algorithm that can predict the price of used cars based on various associated factors. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## **Steps Followed in the Case Study**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Acquired the dataset containing various features related to used cars.
- Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.
- Scaled numerical features to standardize data distribution.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized key relationships between features and car prices.
- Identified outliers and anomalies using box plots and histograms.
- Analyzed correlation between numerical variables to remove redundant features.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Selected the most relevant features based on correlation and importance scores.
- Created new features if necessary to enhance predictive power.
- Applied feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization) for better model performance.

### **4. Model Selection & Training**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluated multiple regression models to determine the best fit:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regression**
  - **Gradient Boosting Regression**
- Used Cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Assessed model performance using key metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R-squared Score (R²)**
- Compared different models to select the best-performing one.

### **6. Model Deployment**
- Saved the best model using **Pickle/Joblib** for future predictions.
- Developed a web interface using **Flask/Django** for user interaction.
- Integrated the model with the web application for real-time price predictions.
